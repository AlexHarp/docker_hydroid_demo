In contemporary culture[edit]

Fillion has been associated with the public artist Martin Firrell since 2009. Fillion is the subject of two works of contemporary public art by the artist: Complete Hero (digital projections of text and video portraiture to the West and North elevations of the Guards Chapel, Wellington Barracks, London, 2009)[46] and Metascifi (digital app investigating American television science fiction series for ideas and strategies for living well).[47]

Fillion was the 'face' of Complete Hero. The artist explained the choice of Fillion as follows: "I wanted to make a piece of work that looked at all kinds of heroism, not just the usual derring-do of white square-jawed men. But I thought it would be interesting to start with a white, square-jawed man and Nathan Fillion agreed to take part." [46]

In Metascifi, Fillion discusses the deeper significance of his Firefly character Captain Mal Reynolds, reflecting on some of the universal preoccupations of any human life: death, love, evil, intimacy, power, vulnerability, violence and freedom.[47]

Personal life[edit]
Fillion has an older brother, Jeff.[4]
